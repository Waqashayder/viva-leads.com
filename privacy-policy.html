                            Your privacy is important to us and we take commercially
                            reasonable measures to protect the security of the personal
                            information we collect both during transmission and once we
                            receive it. Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail,
                            you should not send information that you consider highly
                            sensitive through this Web site. We use commercially reasonable
                            security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable
                            information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally
                            destroyed. We also use software programs that monitor network
                            traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
                            information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized
                            law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify
                            individual users or their usage habits. No method of
                            transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage
                            is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                            absolute security.

                            categories of information shared and the entities to which such
                            information was provided; or (2) to be notified of a mechanism
                            by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information
